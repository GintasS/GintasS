Hello there ðŸ‘‹<br><br>
I am a graduate Information Technology student at Vilnius University. <br><br>
My work focuses on the back-end side with <b>C#</b> and <b>.NET</b> stack, but I also enjoy working with <b>python</b> :snake: on <b>data science projects</b>, not forgetting <b>game development</b> :video_game: with <b>Unity</b>.<br>

Since high-school, I've also created various <b>websites</b>, <b>mobile apps</b>, and <b>scientific projects</b>. This diverse IT experience has led me to understand that the IT world is way too huge to put yourself into one corner, so I hope I'll be able to touch all of those corners.


<p>I very much enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks. ðŸ’¡<br>
Currently, I'm working at CERN on data analysis with Python, Numpy, Pandas, and Dask.
