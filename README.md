### Little about me 🧍

<p>Hello there 👋,</p>
<p>I picked an image with this stunning view for a reason. I love hiking 🥾, every minute of it!This is a good way of exploring your country 🗺️, making new friends, taking your mind off something.</p>
<p>Apart from that, let's jump into the code part: I'm a software developer who mostly works on <b>C#</b>, <b>.NET stack</b>, with some exceptions like <b>python</b> on <b>data science projects</b> and some other topics, technologies. Since my journey in IT, that was started while being in high-school, I've tried many different IT sides, be it developing <b>computer games</b>, <b>websites</b>, <b>mobile apps</b> and more. This has led me into an understanding, that IT world is way too huge to put yourself into one corner, so I hope I'll be able to touch all of those corners.

### “Learning never exhausts the mind.” ― Leonardo da Vinci 📘

<p><a href="https://waylonwalker.com/latest"><img width="250" height="180" align='left' src="https://excellencereporterdotcom.files.wordpress.com/2020/07/davinci-header-2400x1600-jgt.jpg"></a>
  
  I believe one must constantly learn. Be it a small thing, an article about a discovery on a news website, or a bigger one, like learning a new language, one must learn regularly. 🕐</p>
<p>I try to follow this quote by reading things on Stack Exchange Network: 
  <a href="https://history.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">history</a>, 
  <a href="https://workplace.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">workplace</a>,
  <a href="https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">the great outdoors</a>, reading various newsletters, watching courses on
  <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">PluralSight</a> or just doing a hobby project on a topic that I would like to learn.
