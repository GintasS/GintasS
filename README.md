<p>Hello there ðŸ‘‹,</p>
<p>I'm a software developer who mostly works on <b>C#</b>, <b>.NET stack</b>, with some exceptions like <b>python</b> on <b>data science projects</b> and some other topics, technologies. Since my journey in IT, that was started while being in high-school, I've tried many different IT sides, be it developing <b>computer games</b>, <b>websites</b>, <b>mobile apps</b> and more. This has led me into an understanding, that IT world is way too huge to put yourself into one corner, so I hope I'll be able to touch all of those corners.

</p>
