Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile! ðŸ‘‹

I am a graduate of Vilnius University, holding a degree in Information Technology. My primary expertise lies in back-end development, specializing in the C# and .NET stack. Additionally, I am passionate about Python and its applications in data science. I also enjoy exploring game development using Unity, and have a growing interest in edTech and its potential to transform education.

Recently, I've begun delving into the world of artificial intelligence and generative AI.

My experience in IT dates back to high school, where I worked on various websites, mobile applications, and scientific projects. This broad exposure has shown me the vastness of the IT field, inspiring me to continuously explore new areas and technologies.

I am always enthusiastic about learning new frameworks and technologies, and I look forward to expanding my skill set. ðŸ’¡
