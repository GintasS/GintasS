<p>Hello there ðŸ‘‹,</p>
<p>I am a Information Technology undergraduate in Vilnius University.<br><br>
 I mostly work on the back-end side with <b>C#</b> and <b>.NET</b> stack, but I also enjoy working with <b>python</b> :snake: on <b>data science projects</b>, not forgetting <b>game development</b> with <b>Unity</b>.<br><br>
 Since high-school, I've also created <b>websites</b>, <b>mobile apps</b> :phone: and <b>scientific projects</b> :satellite:. This whole IT experience has led me into an understanding, that IT world is way too huge to put yourself into one corner, so I hope I'll be able to touch all of those corners.
</p>

<p>I also very much enjoy learning new technologies and frameworks. :bulb:<br>
  Recently I've discovered open-source, also been working on creating API with Java. :snowman:
