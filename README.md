### Little about me

<p>Hi there üëã</p>
<p>
 I picked an image with this stunning view for a reason. I love hiking, every minute of it!This is a good way of exploring your country, making new friends, taking your mind off something.Apart from that, let's jump into the code part of myself: I'm a software developer who mostly works on C#, .NET stack and sometimes with python on data science.<br>You can find some of my projects on my personal website: <a href="https://gsvedas.com/" target="_blank">gsvedas.com</a></p>

### ‚ÄúLearning never exhausts the mind.‚Äù ‚Äï Leonardo da Vinci

<p>I believe one must constantly learn. Be it a small thing, an article about a discovery on some of a news website, or a bigger one, like learning new language, one must learn.<br>I try to follow this quote by reading things on Stack Exchange network: 
  <a href="https://history.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">history</a>, 
  <a href="https://workplace.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">workplace</a>,
  <a href="https://outdoors.stackexchange.com/" target="_blank">the great outdoors</a>, reading various newsletters, watching courses on
  <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/" target="_blank">PluralSight</a> or just doing a hobby project on a topic that I would like to learn.
